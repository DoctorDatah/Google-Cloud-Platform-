# Where to Save SSH Keys

## When Running `ssh-keygen`
When executing the `ssh-keygen` command, you will be prompted with:
```plaintext
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

## Where Should You Save It?
The default location is `/home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa` (or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`). In most cases, you should accept the default by pressing **Enter**.

### Saving in the SSH Folder (Example for Windows)
```plaintext
Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\Malik Hassan Qayyum/.ssh/id_rsa):
C:\Users\Malik Hassan Qayyum/.ssh/id_airflow
C:\Users\Malik Hassan Qayyum/.ssh/id_airbyte
```

## Why Use the Default Location?
- **Standardized Location:** The SSH client automatically looks for private keys in `~/.ssh`, ensuring seamless operation.
- **Easy Management:** Keeping all SSH keys in the same directory maintains organization.

## When to Specify a Custom Location
You may need to specify a different filename or directory in these cases:

### Multiple Projects or VMs
If you need separate keys for different VMs, services, or users, use a custom name to differentiate them:
```plaintext
/home/youruser/.ssh/id_airflow
/home/youruser/.ssh/id_airbyte
```

### Avoid Overwriting Existing Keys
If you already have a key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and do not want to overwrite it, specify a unique name:
```plaintext
/home/youruser/.ssh/id_custom_project
```

### For a Specific Service
When generating a key specifically for Airflow or Airbyte, you might save it as:
```plaintext
/home/youruser/.ssh/id_airflow
```

## How to Handle Multiple Keys
If you save the key to a custom location, you need to tell the SSH client which key to use when connecting to the VM. To do this:

### Edit Your SSH Configuration File
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

### Add an Entry for Your VM
```plaintext
Host airflow-vm
    HostName <vm-ip>
    User airflow
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_airflow
```

## Final Recommendations
- Use the **default location** unless you need multiple keys.
- Always remember **where you save your key**, as you will need it for configuration and connection.
- **Avoid overwriting existing keys** unless you are certain they are no longer in use.
