# 3. GCP VM Setup (with Explanations)

This section walks through the creation and configuration of a GCP Virtual Machine (VM) to host Airflow and Airbyte. Each step includes an explanation of why it is being done and a breakdown of the associated commands.

## Step 1: Create the GCP VM

### Why?
The VM serves as the central environment for hosting both Airflow and Airbyte. Using a GCP VM ensures scalability, availability, and flexibility for development and production use.

### Steps to Follow

#### Navigate to the GCP Console
The GCP Console is where you manage cloud resources.

**Why?** Creating the VM here gives you access to GCP's full suite of tools and features for monitoring, scaling, and networking.

#### Choose a Machine Type and Configuration

- **Machine Type:** Select `e2-medium` or higher depending on the workload.
  - **Why?** `e2-medium` offers 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM, which is sufficient for moderate workloads. You can scale this later as needed.
- **Boot Disk:** Select **Debian 11** or **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
  - **Why?** These are lightweight, stable operating systems well-suited for hosting services like Airflow and Airbyte.
- **Firewall:**
  - Check **Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic** to enable access to the services.

#### Command to Verify VM Creation (if using gcloud CLI):
```bash
gcloud compute instances list
```

**What it does:** Lists all your VM instances to confirm that your VM is up and running.

## Step 2: Configure Firewall Rules

### Why?
By default, GCP blocks all incoming traffic except for SSH (port 22). To access the Airflow webserver (8080) and Airbyte UI (8000), you need to create rules to allow traffic on these ports.

### Steps to Configure

#### Add Firewall Rules (via GCP Console or CLI):

Use the GCP Console under **VPC Network → Firewall** to configure. Alternatively, use the `gcloud` command:

```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-airflow-airbyte-traffic \  
  --direction=INGRESS \  
  --priority=1000 \  
  --network=default \  
  --action=ALLOW \  
  --rules=tcp:22,tcp:8080,tcp:8000 \  
  --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \  
  --target-tags=airflow-airbyte
```

**What it does:**
- Opens ports **22, 8080, and 8000** for incoming traffic.
- `--source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0`: Allows all IPs (not secure for production—restrict to specific IPs in production).
- `--target-tags=airflow-airbyte`: Associates the rule with your VM.

## Step 3: SSH into the VM

### Why?
You need SSH access to the VM to install software, configure services, and manage users.

### Steps to Connect

#### From GCP Console:
Click **SSH** next to your VM in **Compute Engine → VM Instances**.

**Why?** This provides a browser-based terminal, which is quick and does not require setting up SSH keys locally.

#### Using the Command Line (if you have Google Cloud SDK locally):
```bash
gcloud compute ssh <vm-name> --zone=<zone>
```

**What it does:** Opens an SSH session into your VM from your local terminal.
- Replace `<vm-name>` with the name of your VM.
- Replace `<zone>` with its zone (e.g., `us-central1-a`).

## Step 4: Create Linux Users for Airflow and Airbyte

### Why?
Running services under separate Linux users ensures isolation. If one service is compromised or crashes, the other remains unaffected. This also limits permissions, reducing security risks.

### Steps to Create Users

#### Create a User:
```bash
sudo adduser airflow
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a new Linux user named **airflow**.
- Prompts you to set a password (optional, since SSH keys will be used).
- Automatically creates a home directory at `/home/airflow`.

#### Repeat for Airbyte:
```bash
sudo adduser airbyte
```

**Why?** Each service gets its own user, keeping processes and files isolated.

#### Set Up `.ssh` Directories:
Each user needs an `.ssh` directory to store their authorized keys for SSH access.
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /home/airflow/.ssh
sudo mkdir -p /home/airbyte/.ssh
```

**What it does:** Creates a secure directory for storing SSH keys.

#### Set Correct Permissions:
```bash
sudo chmod 700 /home/airflow/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/airbyte/.ssh
sudo chown -R airflow:airflow /home/airflow/.ssh
sudo chown -R airbyte:airbyte /home/airbyte/.ssh
```

**What it does:**
- `chmod 700`: Ensures only the user has access to their `.ssh` directory.
- `chown`: Makes the user (**airflow** or **airbyte**) the owner of their `.ssh` directory.

#### Authorized Keys:
Add the public SSH keys for secure access:
```bash
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB..." | sudo tee /home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB..." | sudo tee /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**What it does:**
- Stores the public key in the `authorized_keys` file.
- The VM will use this key to authenticate the user during SSH login.

#### Set Permissions for `authorized_keys`:
```bash
sudo chmod 600 /home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 600 /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**What it does:**
- `chmod 600`: Ensures only the user can read or write their `authorized_keys` file.

## Summary of Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `sudo adduser airflow` | Creates a user for Airflow. |
| `sudo adduser airbyte` | Creates a user for Airbyte. |
| `sudo mkdir -p /home/<user>/.ssh` | Creates a secure directory for storing SSH keys. |
| `sudo chmod 700 /home/<user>/.ssh` | Sets permissions to secure the `.ssh` directory. |
| `sudo chown -R <user>:<user> /home/<user>` | Assigns ownership of the home directory to the user. |
| `echo "ssh-rsa..." | sudo tee /home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys` | Adds an authorized key for secure SSH access. |

The VM is now ready with isolated Linux users and SSH access configured. In the next section, we will set up **Airflow and Airbyte** on this VM. Let me know when you are ready to proceed.
