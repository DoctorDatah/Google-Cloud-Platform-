# Explanation of Airflow Environment Setup Commands

These commands are setting up the **Airflow home directory**, which is the central location where **Apache Airflow** stores configuration files, logs, DAGs, and other metadata.

---

## 1. Set Airflow Home Environment Variable

```bash
export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow
```

### What This Does
- `export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow` sets the **AIRFLOW_HOME** environment variable to `~/airflow` (the Airflow directory inside the user's home folder).
- This means that **Airflow will store its configuration files, logs, and DAGs inside `~/airflow`**.

### Why Is This Needed?
- By default, Airflow looks for configurations in `~/airflow`.
- Explicitly setting this variable ensures that **all Airflow commands use this directory as the base**.

---

## 2. Create the Airflow Home Directory

```bash
mkdir -p $AIRFLOW_HOME
```

### What This Does
- `mkdir -p` ensures that the directory **exists**.
- The `-p` flag prevents errors **if the directory already exists**.
- `$AIRFLOW_HOME` expands to `~/airflow`, so this command is equivalent to:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/airflow
```

### Why Is This Needed?
- **Airflow requires a directory** to store its **configurations, logs, and DAGs**.
- If the directory does not exist, **Airflow commands may fail**.

---

## 3. Persist the Airflow Home Path

```bash
echo "export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### What This Does
- Appends the `AIRFLOW_HOME` variable to `~/.bashrc`, which is a **configuration file that runs every time a new terminal session starts**.
- This ensures that the `AIRFLOW_HOME` variable is **set automatically every time you log in or open a new terminal session**.

### Why Is This Needed?
- If you **only use** `export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow` **in the terminal**, the setting is **temporary** and will be **lost when you close the terminal**.
- Adding it to `~/.bashrc` makes it **persistent**, so **every new session automatically loads** the `AIRFLOW_HOME` variable.

---

## 4. Apply the Changes

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### What This Does
- `source ~/.bashrc` **reloads the `~/.bashrc` file** so that the changes take effect immediately **without requiring a logout or terminal restart**.

### Why Is This Needed?
- After updating `~/.bashrc`, **you need to reload it** for the changes to take effect.
- Running `source ~/.bashrc` ensures the **AIRFLOW_HOME variable is available in the current session**.

## Summary of What These Commands Do

| **Command** | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|
| `export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow` | Sets Airflow's home directory (temporary). |
| `mkdir -p $AIRFLOW_HOME` | Ensures the Airflow directory exists. |
| `echo "export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow" >> ~/.bashrc` | Makes the Airflow home directory setting **permanent**. |
| `source ~/.bashrc` | Applies the changes immediately **without restarting the terminal**. |

---

## Next Steps After Setting Up `AIRFLOW_HOME`

### Initialize the Airflow Database:
```bash
airflow db init
```
- This sets up the **Airflow metadata database** inside `$AIRFLOW_HOME`.

### Start Airflow Webserver:
```bash
airflow webserver -p 8080
```
- Runs the **Airflow web interface**.

### Start the Scheduler:
```bash
airflow scheduler
```
- Manages **DAG execution**.

---

This setup ensures that **Airflow runs smoothly** in a dedicated directory and is configured **persistently** across terminal sessions.
