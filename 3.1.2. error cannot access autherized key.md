# Fixing `chmod: cannot access '/home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys'` Error

The error occurs because the `.ssh` directory or the `authorized_keys` file does not exist for the `airbyte` user. Here’s how to fix this step by step:

## Step 1: Create the `.ssh` Directory for the User

### Create the `.ssh` Directory
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /home/airbyte/.ssh
```
#### Explanation:
- `-p`: Ensures the directory is created, including any necessary parent directories.

### Set the Correct Permissions for the `.ssh` Directory
```bash
sudo chmod 700 /home/airbyte/.ssh
```
#### Why?
- `chmod 700`: Grants full access to the `airbyte` user but prevents access by others.

### Change Ownership of the Directory
```bash
sudo chown -R airbyte:airbyte /home/airbyte/.ssh
```
#### Why?
- Ensures the `airbyte` user owns the `.ssh` directory and can access it.

## Step 2: Create the `authorized_keys` File

### Add the Public Key to the `authorized_keys` File
```bash
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...developer-key" | sudo tee -a /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
#### What This Does:
- Appends the developer’s public SSH key to the `authorized_keys` file for the `airbyte` user.

### Set the Correct Permissions for the File
```bash
sudo chmod 600 /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
#### Why?
- `chmod 600`: Grants read and write access only to the `airbyte` user, ensuring security.

### Change Ownership of the File
```bash
sudo chown airbyte:airbyte /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
#### Why?
- Ensures the file is owned by the `airbyte` user.

## Step 3: Verify the Setup

### Check the `.ssh` Directory and File Permissions
```bash
ls -ld /home/airbyte/.ssh
ls -l /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
#### Expected Output:
- `.ssh` directory with `drwx------` permissions.
- `authorized_keys` file with `-rw-------` permissions.

### Test SSH Access to the `airbyte` User
```bash
ssh airbyte@<vm-ip>
```
#### Expected Behavior:
- If the setup is correct, you should log in without being prompted for a password (assuming the private key is properly configured locally).

## Troubleshooting

### If the Directory Still Doesn’t Exist
Ensure the `airbyte` user was created:
```bash
sudo adduser airbyte
```
Then repeat the steps above.

### If Permissions Are Incorrect
Reapply the commands for `chmod` and `chown` carefully, as improper permissions can block SSH access.
