# SSH Key Management Related to Airflow and Airbyte Setup

For your Airflow and Airbyte deployment on a GCP VM, managing SSH keys properly ensures secure developer access and service isolation. This guide outlines best practices and step-by-step instructions for handling SSH keys securely.

## Why SSH Keys are Essential for Airflow and Airbyte Setup

### Secure Developer Access
Each developer needs access to the GCP VM to edit Airflow DAGs, configure Airbyte connections, and troubleshoot. SSH keys ensure secure, passwordless access for these tasks.

### Isolated Users
- Separate Linux users for Airflow and Airbyte
- Each user can have its own SSH key to maintain isolation, ensuring no unnecessary access between services

### Convenience with Security
Developers can use **VS Code Remote-SSH** for seamless file editing and debugging directly on the VM.

## Steps to Generate and Add Missing SSH Keys

### Step 1: Generate SSH Keys for Developers or Services
Developers or team members who need access to the VM should generate their SSH keys locally.

#### Command (Run on Developer’s Machine)
```bash
ls ~/.ssh  # List all existing SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "developer_email@example.com"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C malik_hassan
```

#### What This Does
- Generates a public-private key pair:
  - **Private key**: Stays securely on the developer's machine.
  - **Public key**: Will be added to the VM for authentication.

#### Where to Save It
Refer to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVANqgz9mpLMWMVRim0skjXTXlVtTmqKNMoIRv9Qfqs/edit?tab=t.z62r8mgb1iu4).

### Step 2: Add SSH Keys to the GCP VM

#### For Airflow User
Add the developer’s public key to the Airflow user’s `authorized_keys` file:
```bash
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...developer-key" | sudo tee -a /home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 600 /home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown airflow:airflow /home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### What This Does
- Appends the developer’s public key to the `authorized_keys` file.
- Ensures the Airflow user can authenticate using the developer’s private key.

#### For Airbyte User
Similarly, add the developer’s key to the Airbyte user:
```bash
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...developer-key" | sudo tee -a /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 600 /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown airbyte:airbyte /home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### Error Handling
If you encounter:
```bash
chmod: cannot access '/home/airbyte/.ssh/authorized_keys': No such file or directory
```
Ensure you have followed previous commands correctly. If the issue persists, refer to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVANqgz9mpLMWMVRim0skjXTXlVtTmqKNMoIRv9Qfqs/edit?tab=t.1xpyq539b7yq).

### Step 3: Configure Developers to Access the GCP VM

On the developer’s machine, add the VM’s public IP to the local `~/.ssh/config` file for seamless access.

#### Open the SSH Config File
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

#### Add the Following Entry
```ini
Host airflow-vm
    HostName <vm-ip>
    User airflow
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host airbyte-vm
    HostName <vm-ip>
    User airbyte
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Example for Specific User:
```ini
Host airflow-vm
    HostName 34.130.223.147
    User airflow
    IdentityFile "C:\Users\Malik Hassan Qayyum\.ssh\id_airflow"

Host airbyte-vm
    HostName 34.130.223.147
    User airbyte
    IdentityFile "C:\Users\Malik Hassan Qayyum\.ssh\id_airbyte"
```

#### Test the Connection
```bash
ssh airflow-vm
```

This should log the developer into the Airflow user on the VM.

### Step 4: Set Up VS Code Remote-SSH

#### Install the Remote-SSH Extension
1. In VS Code, go to Extensions and search for **Remote - SSH**.
2. Install the extension.

#### Connect to the VM
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Select **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host**.
3. Enter the host configured in `~/.ssh/config` (e.g., `airflow-vm` or `airbyte-vm`).

#### Work with Files
Once connected, VS Code will open the remote VM’s file system. You can now directly edit **Airflow DAGs** or **Airbyte configuration files** on the VM.

## Best Practices for SSH Key Management

### Unique Keys for Developers
Each developer should have their own SSH key added to the VM. This ensures accountability and allows you to revoke individual access if needed.

### Rotate Keys Regularly
Rotate SSH keys periodically (e.g., every **6 months**) to maintain security.

### Avoid Sharing Keys
Never share private keys between developers or store them in public repositories.

### Secure the VM
Disable password authentication in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```ini
PasswordAuthentication no
```

#### Restart SSH to Apply Changes
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Restrict Access to Necessary Users
Use the `AllowUsers` directive in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to limit SSH access to specific users:
```ini
AllowUsers airflow airbyte
```

## Key Benefits
- **Secure and passwordless access** for developers and services.
- **Proper isolation** between Airflow and Airbyte users.
- **Convenient editing and debugging** using VS Code, directly on the GCP VM.
